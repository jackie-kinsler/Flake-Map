# SnowPack Map

SnowPack Map was developed for skiers and hikers. When planning for an adventure, its often desired to overlay trail data, snow depth information, and terrain maps... SnowPack Map finally makes that possible! 
<br>
SnowPack Map enables users to look at curent or historical snow depth data. Users can overlay GPS data on the map to get a detailed view of the snow depth they can plan to encounter on their next outdoor endeavor.

## <a name="features"></a>Features

SnowPack Map's main feature is a searchable map onto which current and historical snow data can be overlaid.

On the /trails page, users can query for trails, and view trail information on the map.

Users can also add trails to their favorites.

Users can suggest new trails.

Moderators can approve, edit, or delete suggestions. Then, the suggested trail will be findable on the trails page. 

## <a name="instillation"></a>Installation 

To run SnowPack Map on your own machine: 

* Install Python 
* Install PostgreSQL (MAC OXS)

Clone or fork this repo: 
```bash
https://github.com/jackie-kinsler/snowpack
```

Create and activate a virtual environment inside the SnowPack directory: 
```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

With the virtual environment active, install dependencies: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Sign up to use the <a href= "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google Maps API </a> and <a href= "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key"> request an API key</a>.

NOTE: Once you have an API key, you will also need to <a href= "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places">turn on the Google Maps Places library</a>. This is needed for the searchbar to work. 

Save the API keys into a file called `secrets.sh` using this format:  

```bash
export GOOGLE_MAP_API="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```
Set up and retreive your Google OAuth 2.0 client IDs, and save them in the same `secrets.sh` file. 
Ensure that the approved URIs include your localhost and port. 

`secrets.sh` should now look like this: 
```bash
export GOOGLE_MAP_API="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_ID_HERE"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
```

Copy the API keys from the `secrets.sh` file into the environment. 

```bash
source secrests.sh
```

Now, set up a database (call it `mapping`). 

```bash
createdb mapping
python model.py
python seed_database.py 
```
Run the app!

```bash
python servery.py
```

## <a name="future"></a>Next Steps
The project roadmap for SnowPack Map has several features planned: 
* Improve search algorithm when filtering for trails
* Include an option to only search trails inside of the map bounds 
* Email users when their suggestions have been approved
* Push search parameters into the URL so queries can easily be shared
