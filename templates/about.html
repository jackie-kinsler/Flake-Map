                SnowPack Map was created to make adventure planning easier! 
                SnowPack Map pulls data from the <a href="https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/earth/">
                NOAA NOHRSC </a>snow data page. 
                By default, the map shows the latest available data from NOAA. 
                Users can also look at historical snow data (going back to 2012)! 
                Have fun finding snow… or avoiding it.

                SnowPack Map was created by 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackie-kinsler/">Jackie Kinsler</a>
                as her Hackbright Academy capstone project. <br> <br>
                <!-- <strong>Backend:</strong> Python, Flask, SQL <br>
                The backend is written in Python and uses Flask as a web framework. 
                The data is housed in a SQL database. SQLAlchemy is used to access 
                and modify the tables. Tables include trail data, user favorites, 
                and user suggestions. Moderators have the ability to modify the database 
                from the front end on the moderator page (you may not 
                be able to see this… sorry, we can’t all be moderators 
                <img class="smile" src="/static/images/smile.svg">).
                Log-in is handled using OAuth2.0 with Google credentials.

                <strong>Frontend:</strong> JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Google Maps JavaScript API, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS
                <br>
                The Google Maps JavaScript API is used for mapping. Snow data is pulled 
                from the NOAA NOHRSC snow data page and overlaid on the map. 
                On the snowpackmap.com/trails page, trailheads and GPS data 
                (if available) can also be overlaid on the map. Logged in users can 
                favorite trails or make trail suggestions.  Most interactivity on the site is 
                handled using JS and AJAX requests.  -->
